# DSSC Toolbox: Data Space Technology Investigation

## Overview

Modern organizations increasingly need to exchange data across different
institutions and platforms. However, traditional data sharing approaches,
such as direct database access or conventional API-based exchange, often
provide limited mechanisms for ensuring:

- Data sovereignty
- Trust management
- Semantic interoperability
- Controlled data usage

To address these challenges, the concept of **Data Spaces** has emerged as
a decentralized framework that enables organizations to exchange data while
maintaining control over their own data assets.

The **Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC)** provides architectures, guidelines,
and technical resources to support the development of interoperable Data
Spaces.

This project investigates key technologies required to build a functional
Data Space ecosystem, including:

- **Semantic Governance**
- **Trust and Compliance**
- **Data Exchange and Connectors**
- **Validation and Conformance Testing**

The objective of this project is to understand how these components
cooperate and how they can support a complete governed data-sharing
workflow.

# Research Scenario

## Building Energy Consumption Data Product

To demonstrate the interaction between different Data Space technologies,
this project adopts a unified energy data-sharing scenario.

An energy data provider publishes an hourly building energy consumption
dataset. A city analytics organisation discovers the data product and
requests access.

Before data exchange is permitted, the Data Space requires:

- Semantic consistency
- Metadata validation
- Trusted participant verification
- Policy-controlled data exchange

# Data Space Architecture

A Data Space is not a single software platform. Instead, it consists of
multiple specialised components that cooperate through common standards.

The four groups investigated in this project represent different layers of
the Data Space ecosystem.

# Group A Contribution: Data Exchange and Connector Layer

## Research Focus

Group A investigates how organisations exchange data within a Data Space through connector technologies.

The main technologies studied are:

- **FIWARE Data Space Connector**
- **TNO Trusted Secure Gateway (TSG)**

The research focuses on:

- Secure data exchange
- Data sovereignty preservation
- Contract-based data sharing
- Policy-controlled access
- Interoperable connector architecture

---

# What is a Data Space Connector?

A **Data Space Connector** is a software component deployed by each participant in a Data Space to enable secure, controlled, and sovereign data exchange.

Unlike a traditional API gateway, a connector does not only expose data endpoints. Instead, it supports the complete lifecycle of governed data sharing:

- Data offering publication
- Metadata exchange
- Data discovery
- Contract negotiation
- Policy enforcement
- Governed data transfer

Therefore, the connector acts as the operational exchange layer of a Data Space, working together with semantic services, trust frameworks, and validation mechanisms to enable interoperable and trustworthy data sharing.

# Data Exchange Demonstration

To validate the connector workflow in the unified energy scenario, Group A
provides a demonstration of the Building Energy Consumption Dataset exchange
process.

The demo illustrates:

- Data offering publication
- Metadata discovery
- Consumer access request
- Contract negotiation
- Governed data transfer

The demonstration focuses on how a dataset is transformed from a traditional
API resource into a governed Data Product within a Data Space environment.

Detailed demonstration workflow:

```

```

## Process

### 1. Package Dataset as Data Offering

The Building Energy Consumption Dataset is transformed into a Data Space Data Offering containing:

- Dataset description
- Semantic metadata
- Access information
- Usage policies
- Provider information

The Data Offering represents the dataset as a governed and discoverable digital asset within the Data Space.

---

### 2. Publish Metadata

The connector publishes metadata information to enable data discovery.

Consumers can:

- Discover available datasets
- Understand dataset characteristics
- Review access conditions
- Identify applicable usage policies

---

### 3. Consumer Discovery and Access Request

A consumer searches available Data Offerings and submits an access request.

The connector verifies:

- Participant identity and trust information
- Access permissions
- Usage policies
- Contract requirements

---

### 4. Contract Negotiation and Governed Data Transfer

After successful negotiation:

- Access rights are established
- Usage policies are enforced
- Data is transferred through the connector under agreed conditions

The connector ensures that data exchange follows Data Space principles, including sovereignty, transparency, and controlled usage.

# Key Findings

## Strengths

The Data Space connector approach provides several advantages:

### Standards-based Architecture

Enables interoperability between different organisations through common protocols, specifications, and open standards.

### Data Sovereignty Support

Allows data owners to maintain control over:

- Who can access their data
- Under which conditions data can be used
- How data usage policies are enforced

### Modular and Extensible Design

The connector architecture separates different functional components, allowing individual services to evolve independently.

### Distributed Data Space Compatibility

Supports collaboration between independent organisations without requiring centralised data storage or control.

### Policy-controlled Data Exchange

Enables governed data sharing based on:

- Usage agreements
- Access permissions
- Contractual rules
- Data governance policies

# Limitations

Several challenges remain for practical Data Space deployment:

## High Deployment Complexity

A complete Data Space environment requires integration of multiple supporting components, including:

- Identity management
- Trust frameworks
- Semantic services
- Policy engines
- Connector infrastructure

## Dependency on External Components

Connectors rely on additional services for:

- Participant verification
- Credential management
- Semantic interoperability
- Trust establishment

## Steep Learning Curve

Data Space concepts, protocols, and governance mechanisms require significant technical knowledge and understanding.

## Production Deployment Requirements

Real-world deployment requires:

- Reliable infrastructure
- Security management
- Monitoring and maintenance
- Operational support

---

# Future Work

Potential future improvements include:

- Complete end-to-end deployment of multiple Data Space components
- Integration with real-world energy datasets
- Automated participant onboarding workflows
- More comprehensive contract negotiation experiments
- Evaluation of additional connector implementations
- Performance and scalability testing

---

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a Data Space cannot be established through a single technology.

Instead, a complete Data Space ecosystem requires cooperation between:

- Semantic governance
- Trust management
- Validation services
- Data exchange connectors

The connector layer provides the operational foundation of the Data Space by enabling participants to:

- Publish data offerings
- Discover available datasets
- Negotiate access agreements
- Exchange data securely

while maintaining:

- Data sovereignty
- Security
- Transparency
- Interoperability

Through the Building Energy Consumption scenario, this project illustrates how technologies such as the **FIWARE Data Space Connector** and **TNO Trusted Secure Gateway (TSG)** support the development of a trustworthy and interoperable energy data-sharing ecosystem.
