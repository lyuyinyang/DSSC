# 1. Architecture Overview

## Purpose

A Data Space Connector provides the operational layer for secure and
policy-governed data exchange between independent participants.

Unlike traditional API-based data sharing, where access control is usually
performed before data retrieval, a connector manages the complete exchange
lifecycle:

- Metadata publication
- Data discovery
- Contract negotiation
- Policy enforcement
- Governed data transfer

This document analyses the architecture of Data Space Connectors, focusing on
the FIWARE Data Space Connector as an implementation example.

The analysis covers:

- Connector responsibilities
- Internal functional components
- Exchange workflow
- Standards and interoperability
- Engineering considerations

# 2. Role of Connectors in a Data Space

A Data Space Connector enables organisations to exchange data while
maintaining control over ownership, access conditions and usage policies.

The connector acts as a governance layer between data providers and
consumers.

It is responsible for controlling how data is discovered, accessed and
transferred according to agreed conditions.

## Connector Responsibilities

A Data Space Connector provides:

### Metadata Management

- Publishing data offerings
- Exchanging dataset descriptions
- Supporting data discovery
### Contract Negotiation

- Establishing usage agreements
- Managing access conditions
- Recording negotiation states

### Policy Enforcement

- Evaluating usage rules
- Applying access restrictions
- Ensuring agreement compliance

### Data Transfer Management

- Authorising transfers
- Executing data exchange
- Monitoring transfer status

---

## Connector Boundaries

The connector does not replace other specialised Data Space services.

It does not:

- Create semantic models
- Issue digital identities
- Perform compliance certification
- Validate metadata constraints
- Store all exchanged datasets centrally

Instead, the connector integrates with external trust, semantic and validation
services through standardized interfaces.

---

# 3. FIWARE Data Space Connector Overview

The FIWARE Data Space Connector is an open-source implementation designed to
support standards-based and governed data exchange.

It follows the principles of:

- Data sovereignty
- Policy-controlled access
- Metadata-driven discovery
- Standards-based interoperability

## 3.1 Data Sovereignty

Data providers maintain control over their data assets.

The connector does not require centralised storage of datasets. Instead, it
controls access and transfer according to predefined agreements.

---

## 3.2 Policy Before Data

Data exchange is not performed through unrestricted API access.

Before data transfer:

1. Consumers discover available offerings.
2. Access conditions are negotiated.
3. Policies are evaluated.
4. Data transfer is authorised.

---

## 3.3 Metadata Before Transfer

Metadata discovery occurs before actual data exchange.

Consumers first obtain information about:

- Dataset description
- Provider information
- Access conditions
- Usage policies

---

## 3.4 Standards-based Interoperability

The connector relies on open standards:

- Dataspace Protocol (DSP)
- JSON-LD
- OpenAPI
- HTTP APIs

These standards enable interoperability between different Data Space
implementations.

---

# 4. Connector System Architecture

The connector operates as the communication layer between participants.

It coordinates data exchange functions while integrating with external
services such as identity, semantic and validation systems.

The architecture separates responsibilities into independent components,
improving:

- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Interoperability

# 5. FIWARE Connector Functional Architecture

The FIWARE Data Space Connector follows a modular architecture where each
component performs a specific role in the exchange lifecycle.

## FIWARE Component Architecture

This diagram explains the internal structure of the connector implementation.

---
## 5.1 Catalogue Service

The Catalogue Service manages metadata describing available data offerings.

It enables consumers to discover datasets without directly accessing the
underlying resources.

Typical metadata includes:

- Dataset identifier
- Provider information
- Description
- Endpoint information
- License
- Usage policies

---

## 5.2 Contract Negotiation

Contract negotiation establishes an agreement between provider and consumer
before data access is granted.

The negotiation defines:

- Access permissions
- Usage conditions
- Responsibilities
- Exchange rules

Typical states:

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Requested | Consumer requests access |
| Offered | Provider proposes conditions |
| Accepted | Consumer accepts conditions |
| Finalized | Agreement established |

---

## 5.3 Policy Enforcement

Policy enforcement evaluates whether an access request complies with defined
rules.

Policies may specify:

- Allowed participants
- Usage purpose
- Time restrictions
- Redistribution limitations

---

## 5.4 Transfer Process

The Transfer Process executes the actual exchange after successful
negotiation.

Responsibilities include:

- Transfer initiation
- Secure transmission
- Status monitoring
- Completion tracking

---

# 6. Data Exchange Workflow

The connector follows a governed workflow rather than direct data access.

## Workflow Diagram

![[Data Exchange Workflow.jpg]]

The workflow contains five main stages:

## 6.1 Data Offering Publication

The provider registers a dataset and publishes metadata through the connector.

The published information includes:

- Dataset description
- Provider information
- Access endpoint
- Usage policies

---

## 6.2 Data Discovery

Consumers discover available offerings through catalogue metadata.

The catalogue allows consumers to:

- Search datasets
- Understand characteristics
- Review access conditions

---

## 6.3 Contract Negotiation

The consumer requests access and negotiates usage conditions with the
provider.

The agreement defines:

- Permissions
- Responsibilities
- Usage conditions

---

## 6.4 Policy Verification

The connector evaluates whether the requested access satisfies predefined
policies.

The verification checks:

- Participant permissions
- Contract conditions
- Usage restrictions

---

## 6.5 Governed Data Transfer

After successful negotiation and policy verification, the connector enables
controlled data exchange.

The transfer process ensures:

- Secure transmission
- Policy compliance
- Data sovereignty preservation

---

# 7. Connector Compared with Traditional REST APIs

| Aspect | Traditional REST API | Data Space Connector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main Goal | Data access | Governed data exchange |
| Discovery | API documentation | Metadata catalogue |
| Access Control | Authentication | Contract and policy |
| Metadata | Optional | Required |
| Data Sovereignty | Limited | Preserved |
| Transfer | Immediate access | Agreement-based transfer |
| Interoperability | Implementation dependent | Standards-based |

A connector therefore provides a governance layer above traditional data
exchange mechanisms.

---

# 8. Standards and Protocols

| Standard | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Dataspace Protocol (DSP) | Connector communication |
| JSON-LD | Metadata representation |
| OpenAPI | API description |
| HTTP/HTTPS | Data transport |
| OAuth2 | Authentication |

---

# 9. Engineering Evaluation

## Strengths

### Standards-based Architecture

Uses open standards instead of proprietary communication mechanisms.

### Data Sovereignty

Providers maintain control over data usage throughout the exchange lifecycle.

### Modular Design

Connector functions are separated into independent components.

### Interoperability

Different implementations can participate through common protocols.

---

## Limitations

### Deployment Complexity

A complete environment requires multiple services and configurations.

### External Dependencies

Trust, identity and semantic services require additional integration.

### Learning Curve

Understanding DSP, policies and contract negotiation requires technical
knowledge.

---

# 10. Conclusion

The Data Space Connector provides the operational foundation for governed data
exchange.

Unlike traditional APIs, it manages the complete lifecycle of data sharing,
including:

- Metadata publication
- Data discovery
- Contract negotiation
- Policy evaluation
- Controlled transfer

The FIWARE Data Space Connector demonstrates how modular architecture and open
standards can support secure and interoperable Data Spaces.

However, connectors operate as one component within a larger ecosystem and
must cooperate with specialised services for trust, semantics and validation.
